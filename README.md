# The game of life - the game of life
The game plays out on a grid of slots, and each slot is in one of two states "live" or "dead". The game started, the player chooses which squares to paint, he got to conduct himself (therefore it is also considered a game for zero players). The squares are called "suitable" because their behavior resembles a biological fit that is born, lives and dies according to legal rules, which depend only on their condition and the condition of their closest neighbors.
